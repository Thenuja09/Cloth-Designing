# Cloth-Designing
Cloth designing is the creative process of conceptualizing, developing, and producing fabrics and garments that balance aesthetics, functionality, and innovation. It involves combining artistic vision with technical skills to design patterns, textures, colors, and garment structures that reflect style, culture, and market trends.
